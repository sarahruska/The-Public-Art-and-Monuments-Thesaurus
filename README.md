# The Public Art and Monuments Thesaurus Project
Welcome to the Public Art and Monuments Thesaurus. Public art is any artwork commissioned, owned, and/or displayed
publicly or by a public organization, such as a government or municipal body. Monuments has
 been included in the domain to additionally clarify large-scale public artworks that
 commemorate, elevate, and glorify people, events, and ideas, often while reflecting the ideals
 of those commissioning them and conveying a sociopolitical or religious agenda. 
 This thesaurus  was created to fill a gap in the larger domain of visual art and culture that would be invaluable
 for public art professionals and collections specialists, artists, and researchers looking for
 documents and information about the public art and monuments sub-field of visual art.
